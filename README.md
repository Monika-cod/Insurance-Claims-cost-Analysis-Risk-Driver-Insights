Health Insurance Charges Analysis – Power BI Dashboard

📊 Project Overview

This repository contains an interactive Power BI dashboard developed to analyse health insurance data and identify the major factors influencing medical charges.
The analysis highlights how age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and other demographic factors impact total and individual healthcare costs.

This project aims to support risk assessment, premium decisions, and health policy improvements through data-driven insights.

✅ Key Metrics

Total Charges Analyzed: $17.76M
Total Beneficiaries: 1,338
Average BMI: 31.00 (Obese category)
Average Age: 39 years


Bussiness Problems 

1. What is the distribution of the $17.76M in total charges across different genders, and is there a significant financial disparity between male and female beneficiaries?

2. How does the Average BMI of the current population compare to standard health benchmarks, and is obesity a major driver of the overall insurance costs?

3. To what extent does smoking status influence medical expenses, and what is the ratio of smokers to non-smokers within the policyholder base?

4. How do insurance charges trend as beneficiaries age, and are there specific age groups that represent a disproportionately higher risk?

5. What actionable strategies can be derived from the current data to lower the average claim cost and improve the overall health profile of the beneficiary pool?

🔍 Key Insights & Findings

1. Gender-Based Cost Differences

Male beneficiaries incurred $9.43M in total charges.
Female beneficiaries incurred $8.32M.
This shows men contribute slightly more to overall health costs.

2. BMI & Obesity

Average BMI is 31 (Obese)—a major risk factor contributing to the total charges.

3. Smoking Impact

Smoking is the biggest driver of high charges.
Smokers show significantly higher average charges than non-smokers.

4. Age Trends

Charges increase steadily with age.
Older groups show higher medical expenses.

5. Actionable strategies to reduce claim costs
 
 Focusing on smoking cessation, weight management, and preventive health programs to reduce high-risk behaviours.
Identifying high-BMI and older beneficiaries early can help lower long-term claim costs.

💡 Strategic Recommendations

Health Awareness Programs: Promote smoking cessation & obesity reduction.
Premium Personalisation: Adjust premiums for high-risk groups (smokers, high BMI).
Early Risk Identification: Track high-risk profiles early (older age + obesity).
Preventative Health Care: Encourage early screenings to reduce long-term costs.
